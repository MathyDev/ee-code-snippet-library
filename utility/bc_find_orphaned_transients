# Find Orphaned Transients
# WordPress transients normally are saved as pairs,
# where one record contains the transient data
# and another contains a timestamp defining when the transient expires.
# Sometimes, somehow, transients can have their corresponding timeout record deleted
# which orphans the main record.
# The following query will find all main transient records
# that do NOT have a corresponding timeout record.
# PLZ NOTE:
# you may need to update the WordPress table prefix
# from "wp_" to whatever is used in your database
